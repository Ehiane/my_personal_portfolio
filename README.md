## Description

- The `index.html` file in this repository is the main HTML file for the portfolio website. It includes sections such as header, about, services, portfolio, and contact. The styling for the website is defined in the `styles.css` file.

- The portfolio website is designed to be responsive and visually appealing. It includes various sections to provide information about me, my skills, projects I have worked on, and a way to contact me.

- The JavaScript code handles form submission and sends data to a Google Apps Script web application for storage in Google Sheets, displaying a success message to the user upon submission completion.
## Usage

To use this code for your own portfolio, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Modify the `index.html` file to update the content with your own information, including your name, skills, projects, and contact details.
3. Customize the styling by modifying the `styles.css` file. You can change the colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects to match your preferences.
4. Replace the images in the `images` folder with your own images or use external URLs for images.
5. Optionally, you can customize the JavaScript code in the `<script>` tags in the `index.html` file to add any additional functionality or interactivity you desire.

Once you have customized the code to your liking, you can deploy the portfolio website by hosting the `index.html` file and associated assets on a web server or using a hosting service like GitHub Pages.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the following resources that inspired and helped me in creating my personal portfolio:

- The YouTube video [Creating a Responsive Portfolio Website | HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://youtu.be/0YFrGy_mzjY) by [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevEd) provided me with inspiration and guidance. I replicated and modified certain elements from the tutorial to suit my requirements.

- I also used the YouTube video [How to Publish a Website | Deploy Website to GoDaddy](https://youtu.be/kvyWeTXCSKk) by [Website Learners](https://www.youtube.com/@WebsiteLearners) to learn how to publish my website and have my own domain. This video helped me understand the process of deploying a website, and I followed the steps provided to host my portfolio on [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk).

I express my gratitude to the creators of these resources for sharing their knowledge and expertise, which significantly contributed to the development of my personal portfolio.
